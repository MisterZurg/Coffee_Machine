# Hyperskill_Coffee_Machine
"Coffee Machine" project from Hyperskill
This project allows me to get a taste of Python. 
Practice working with functions, 
challenge myself with loops and conditions, 
and get more confident in Python.

# Project stages
## Stage 1/6 Hello coffee!
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!
## Stage 2/6 Machines have needs
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.
## Stage 3/6 Enough coffee for everyone
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.
## Stage 4/6 Action!
Upgrade your knowledge of functions – set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
## Stage 5/6 On a coffee loop
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.
## Stage 6/6 Brush up your code
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
